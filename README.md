# Service-Fabric-Labs
##Code for Azure Service Fabric labs

This contains the lab documents and code for a set of Azure Service Fabric labs that can be used with minimal hardware.

Before working on this lab, you must have <b>Visual Studio 2015 (with Update 3 or higher)</b> and <b>Service Fabric SDK (v2.2 or higher)</b>. See [Prepare you development environment](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/service-fabric-get-started/) for information on how to install a development environment on your machine.

#Lab 1 - Working with Service Fabric services
Goal of this lab is to make you familiar with an end to end development flow for Service Fabric applications. You will practice creating a new Service Fabric application on your development machine, working with stateless services, deploying, updating and monitoring an application deployment. Throughout the exercise you will get accustomed with Visual Studioâ€™s Service Fabric tooling, Service Fabric Explorer and learn how to effectively use both.

After completing this lab, you will be able to: 

- Set up and manage Service Fabric clusters on your development machine
- Understand the concepts of Service Fabric applications, services, stateless services, application lifecycle management, diagnostics and health
- Use Visual Studio and Service Fabric Explorer to efficiently develop Service Fabric applications

#Lab 2 - Exploring Service Fabric Statful services
Goal of this lab is to make you familiar with an end to end development flow for Service Fabric applications. You will practice adding a stateful service to the stateless voting service fabric that was started in lab one. This will enable votes to be shared across multiple front end services.

After completing this lab, you will be able to: 

- Understand the concepts of Service Fabric manifests
- Understand the concepts of Service Fabric stateful services and the Stateless Gateway pattern
